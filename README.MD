+ We’d like you to create a 2 step application. You are required to write custom JavaScript, HTML and Sass (or css) to reproduce a working version of the designs (see /design folder). We’ve provided you with a starter framework which your custom code should be added to. __Please use this framework and no other__. Installation notes have been provided below.
